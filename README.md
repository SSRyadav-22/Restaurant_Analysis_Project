# Restaurant_Analysis_Project
A Machine Learning Data Analysis project using Python to explore and visualize restaurant data, with a focus on location-based insights and market dynamics.
Restaurant Location-Based Analysis
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of a restaurant dataset, focusing on uncovering insights related to geographical location. The primary goal is to understand restaurant distribution, concentration, and performance across different cities and localities. By using Python libraries like Pandas, Folium, and Matplotlib, this analysis provides a clear picture of the urban dining landscape.

Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values and ensure data types are correct for analysis.

Geospatial Visualization: Create an interactive map to visualize the geographical spread of restaurants.

Concentration Analysis: Identify cities and localities with the highest number of restaurants.

Statistical Aggregation: Calculate key performance metrics (average rating, average cost for two, total votes) grouped by city and locality.

Cuisine Trend Identification: Determine the most common cuisines in major cities and their specific localities.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.

Folium: For creating interactive, location-based maps.

Matplotlib: For static data visualizations (bar plots).

Seaborn: For enhanced data visualizations.

Key Insights and Results
Restaurant Hotspots: The analysis identifies cities with the highest concentration of restaurants, such as New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida, indicating a high-density market.

Locality-Specific Trends: By drilling down into specific cities, the project reveals that certain localities within those cities (e.g., Connaught Place in New Delhi) have unique characteristics in terms of restaurant volume, average rating, and cuisine popularity.

Performance Metrics: The statistical analysis provides a clear comparison of average ratings and costs across different regions, which can be valuable for market entry strategies.

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Restaurant-Analysis-Project.git
cd Restaurant-Analysis-Project

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas folium matplotlib seaborn

Place the dataset:
Ensure the Dataset .csv file is in the root directory of the project.

Run the analysis:
Execute the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code. The interactive map will be saved as restaurant_map.html, and the plots will be displayed.

Data Source
The data used for this analysis is from the Dataset .csv file, which contains information on various restaurants, including their location, ratings, cuisine types, and costs.
